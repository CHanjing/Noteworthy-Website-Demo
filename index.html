                <h1>Noteworthy A Capella</h1>
                <p>
                    Noteworthy is an all gender A Cappella group at The University of Texas at Austin, founded in 2014. Noteworthy is a competitive group; they most recently competed in the ICCA 2022 quarterfinals where they won Best Soloist, and the Chicago Harmony Sweepstakes A Cappella Festival where they placed third. The group loves to perform for the community and at campus affiliated events as well. Noteworthy presents an eclectic sound, bridging genres with their original arrangements. Members range from those with over 15 years of musical experience to those who have never read sheet music. As a diverse group, where every voice is heard, each member is valued for what they bring to the table.
